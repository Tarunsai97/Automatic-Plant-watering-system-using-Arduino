# Automatic-Plant-watering-system-using-Arduino
Whenever me and my family go for vacations, I used to get worried about my plants because they need water on regular basis. I gone through several options to solve this problem as plants need water according to the moisture level of soil. So I have made Automatic Plant Watering System Using Arduino UNO.  In this system, soil moisture sensor senses the moisture level of the soil. If soil will get dry then sensor senses low moisture level and automatically switches on the water pump to supply water to the plant. As plant get sufficient water and soil get wet then sensor senses enough moisture in soil. After which the water pump will automatically get stopped.  I have used a self made water pump in this system using 5 volt DC motor. I could use 12 volt water pump in the system but to operate this, it will require a relay module. So, to reduce all these hardware complexity, I made DC motor based water pump using diode, transistor and registers combined circuit which operates DC motor according to the Arduino code.
